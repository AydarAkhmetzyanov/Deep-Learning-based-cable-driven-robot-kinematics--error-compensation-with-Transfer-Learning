# Cable-Component
Unity cable component implementation similar to the Unreal Engine one based on verlet integration.

This project is a simple and optimized implementation of cable physics in Unity3D, it uses verlet integration[1] to achieve the physics simulation just like UE4 approach[2].

The rendering part still has some work to be done as it is currently using a simple line renderer. Ideally it should use a procedural cable generation approach but it wasn't main the purpouse of this little experiment.
